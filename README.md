## About this Project

A simple clone of some pages of the Instagram interface!!

Only the interface, the features haven't been implemented in this project.

## Why ?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, used to improve my skills in React Native.

## Prerequisites

#### Install Node
Click in this link and install Node in LTS version: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);

#### Install Expo-CLI

If you're using  _**npm**_:

```
 $ npm install -g expo-cli

```

Or If you're using  _**yarn**_:

```
 $ yarn global add expo-cli
```

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn

```

Or if you're using  _**npm**_:

### Running

To run the project make sure that you have the expo-cli in your computer, if you don't have the expo-cli, please read the section  [Prerequisites](https://github.com/gabrielsiilva/InstagramClone/tree/master#prerequisites)

You can check if you have the expo-cli just running this command below in your terminal:

```

If everything's okay and expo returns the version for you, just run this command bellow to start the project:
